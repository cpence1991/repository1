<p>"Kiss is an American rock band formed in New York City in January 1973 by 
        <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="Paul_Stanley.html">Paul Stanley</a>, Gene Simmons, Peter Criss, and Ace Frehley. Well known 
        for its members' face paint and stage outfits, the group rose to prominence in 
        the mid-to-late 1970s with their elaborate live performances, which featured 
        fire breathing, blood-spitting, smoking guitars, shooting rockets, levitating 
        drum kits, and pyrotechnics. The band has gone through several lineup changes, 
        with Stanley and Simmons the only remaining original members. The original and 
        best-known lineup consisted of Stanley (vocals and rhythm guitar), Simmons (vocals and bass), 
        Frehley (lead guitar and vocals), and Criss (drums and vocals).</p>
        <p>With their make-up and costumes, they took on the personae of comic book-style characters: 
        The Starchild (Stanley), The Demon (Simmons), The Spaceman or Space Ace (Frehley), 
        and The Catman (Criss). Due to creative differences, both Criss and Frehley had departed 
        the group by 1982.</p>
        <p>In 1983, Kiss began performing without makeup and costumes, thinking that it 
                was time to leave the makeup behind. The band accordingly experienced a 
                minor commercial resurgence, and their music videos received regular airplay 
                on MTV. Eric Carr, who had replaced Criss in 1980, died in 1991 of heart 
                cancer and was replaced by Eric Singer. In response to a wave of Kiss 
                nostalgia in the mid-1990s, the original lineup re-united in 1996, which 
                also saw the return of their makeup and stage costumes. The resulting Alive/Worldwide 
                Tour was commercially successful. Criss and Frehley have both since left the band 
                again and have been replaced by Singer and Tommy Thayer, respectively. The band 
                has continued with their original stage makeup, with Singer and Thayer using the '
                original Catman and Space Ace makeup, respectively. In September 2018, Kiss announced 
                that, after 45 years of recording and performing, they will embark on their final tour, 
                The End of the Road World Tour, in 2019.</p>
                <p>Kiss is one of the best-selling bands of all time, having sold more than 100 
                        million records worldwide, including 25 million RIAA-certified albums.
                        On April 10, 2014, the four original members of Kiss were inducted into the 
                        Rock and Roll Hall of Fame."
