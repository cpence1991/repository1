                <p><b>It is a period of civil wars in the galaxy. A brave alliance of 
                    underground freedom fighters has challenged the tyranny and oppression 
                    of the awesome GALACTIC EMPIRE.</b></p>
                <p><b>Striking from a fortress hidden among the billion stars of the galaxy, 
                    rebel spaceships have won their first victory in a battle with the 
                    powerful Imperial Starfleet. The EMPIRE fears that another defeat 
                    could bring a thousand more solar systems into the rebellion, and 
                    Imperial control over the galaxy would be lost forever.</b></p>
                <p><b>To crush the rebellion once and for all, the EMPIRE is constructing 
                    a sinister new battle station. Powerful enough to destroy an entire 
                    planet, its completion spells certain doom for the champions of freedom.</b></p>
